# Final-project
Building a B&amp;B website

## Redesigning Residenza Carducci B&amp;B

### Problem statement:

Residenza Carducci is in need to modernize and restyle their website, add interactive features and handle their calendar and bookings.This will enhance user experience and increase traffic on their website. 

## Basic Solution:

The website will be redisigned using angular and bootstrap. The home page will have several features: the possibility to chose between the apartment and the B&B rooms, the possibility to choose between languages and a link to the facebook page.
Each section will have a home page, a section with the rooms availabilty and pricing, a section for faq and a section for location and contacts. The user will be able to send an email via contact form. 


## Intermediate Solution:

We are looking to build is a calendar that efficiently shows the bookings, allows the administrator to manage the different rooms and change availability status. The administrator should be able to read, update and delete the bookings. An interactive mapping feature will be added for the user to be able to route the location using google maps api.

## Advanced Solution:

Ideally the calendar feature would be connected with Booking.com and other booking websites and would be able to import bookings automatically from those sites.
In addition to the previous feature the website should allow for bookings and payment processing via paypal.
It should also allow for the administrator to manage the bookings, and manage client account and emails relative to the bookings.
Clients should receive a booking confirmation email with the details of their booking and contact information.
