Building a B&amp;B website

## Redesigning Residenza Carducci B&amp;B

### Problem statement:

Residenza Carducci is in need of a way to handle their bookings in an efficient and automatic way that will cut time and drastically reduce human error.

## Basic Solution:

The product that we are looking to build is a calendar that efficiently shows the bookings, allows the administrator to manage the different rooms and change availability status. Ideally the calendar feature would be connected with Booking.com and Venere.com and would be able to import bookings automatically from those sites. The administrator should be able to read, update and delete the bookings.

## Intermediate Solution:

The objective is to redo the full website and add an interactive mapping feature and ability to visualize the booking status.

## Advanced Solution:

In addition to the previous feature the website should allow for bookings and payment processing via paypal.
It should also allow for the administrator to manage the bookings, and manage client account and emails relative to the bookings.
Clients should receive a booking confirmation email with the details of their booking and contact information.
