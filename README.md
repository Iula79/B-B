# Final-project
Building a B&amp;B website

## Redesigning Residenza Carducci B&amp;B

### Problem statement:

Residenza Carducci is in need of a way to restyle their website, add interactive features and handle their calendar and bookings.This wold enhance user experience and increase traffic on their website

## Basic Solution:

The webside will be redisign using node, angular and bootstrap. The home page will show a few choices, the possibility to chose between the apartment and the B&B rooms, the possibility to choose between languages and a link to the facebook page.
There will be a home page, a section with the rooms and the availabilty, a section for faq and a section for location and contacts. You will be able to send an email via contact form. In the section with the room there should be a link to book a room wich will take you to the calendar and the reservations. 


## Intermediate Solution:

The product that we are looking to build is a calendar that efficiently shows the bookings, allows the administrator to manage the different rooms and change availability status. The administrator should be able to read, update and delete the bookings.
Also  an interactive mapping feature will be added using google maps api

## Advanced Solution:

Ideally the calendar feature would be connected with Booking.com and Venere.com and would be able to import bookings automatically from those sites.
In addition to the previous feature the website should allow for bookings and payment processing via paypal.
It should also allow for the administrator to manage the bookings, and manage client account and emails relative to the bookings.
Clients should receive a booking confirmation email with the details of their booking and contact information.
