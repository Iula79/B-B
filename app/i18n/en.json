    "saga":{
        "first":"When Augusto Barana decided to turn the family property into an inn, in the late 19th century (at the time called Trattoria Coccodrillo con Alloggio) he did not know that his legacy, though with some twist and turns, was going to remain alive for the next century.",
        "second":"At the beginning of the 20th century the inn was flourishing with guest coming from as far as China, as demonstrated from the retrieval of foreign letters and coins. Tales of a chinese family chanting hymns in their language and of germans riding their bikes all the way from Germany have been reported.",
        "third":"The trattoria, furnished with a huge brick oven, two spacious wine cellars, a back patio and a stallage that animated the street, was a well-known hangout spot in Verona.",
        "fourth":"Following Augusto's premature death in 1942, the locanda saw a streak of increasingly shady managers and started having a reputation of renting rooms by the hour, slowly turning the respectable inn in a underground brothel. The place was shut down by the authorities in 1962 and fell into disrepair.",
        "fifth":"After 30 years of abandonment, the historic building had turned into a wreck: rain and fire had ruined the beams on the back and the floors had partially fallen down bringing with them the old furniture and all the personal items suddenly left behind. Broken basins were dangling from the walls and pigeons were nesting in the empty rooms.",
        "sixth":"In 1990, Augusto's granddaughter Giovanna decided to embark in the restoration of the family house. After a long renovation that treasured and preserved every piece of history that was discovered, the place reopened in 2002 as Bed and Breakfast Residenza Carducci* and Giovanna welcomes guests again from everywhere in the world."
