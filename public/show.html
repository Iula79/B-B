        <p>RESIDENZA VERAZZANO is a large and modern apartment located just outside the walls of the ancient city of Verona, on the top story of a building in a quiet and well-served residential quarter called “quartiere catena”. This quarter takes its name from a tradition started by the Scaligeri family who, here, erected a tower in the center of the Adige river to collect taxes and duties by pulling a chain across the river and blocking entry to boats which, coming from the north, entered the center of the city to carry goods to warehouses and to continue down the river to the Adriatic sea. We can still see this tower in the center of the Adige when we enter into Verona.</p>

        <p>In the winter the apartment is fine for guests in Verona for interim work, holidays, business or who attend the city’s theaters for the winter Symphonic and Opera seasons. It is also convenient for visitors and participants in Verona Fairs (www.veronafiere.it). In the summer the historic center of Verona, an enjoyable walk away passing by the Basilica of San Zeno or over the Castelvecchio bridge, is where guests can enjoy the Arena Opera Season (www.arena.it) and the many summer theater and art events
            (www.estateteatraleveronese.it).
