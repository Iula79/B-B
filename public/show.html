            <p>We are located in the historical part of town called Veronetta, on the left side of the Adige river. Veronetta
                is where the first settlements of the city were and is the home of the roman theatre, the Giardino Giusti
                and Castel San Pietro</p>
            <p>The main square in Veronetta is called Piazza Isolo, due to the fact that the adige river had gradually
                changed its course and the original course remained as a branch of increasingly stiller water. The island in the middle was called 
                Isolo, which means island in italian. The canal was aggraded after a flood in 1882.

            <p>Residenza Carducci is a four story building, initially part of a convent complex as demonstrated by the walled
                doors that were once connecting it to the nearby buildings. The building oldest parts date from the 14th
                century but it was substantially renovated in 1556. The entryway has a characteristic vaulted ceiling entirely
                rivested in brick that leads to a stairway with a fresco depicting a "Madonna con Bambino" dated 1435 and
                attributed to Girolamo Benaglio. </p>
            <p>From the courtyard there is a walled staircase that was presumably connecting the house with the river that once was flowing nearby.</p>
            <p>Among the discoveries there was a mirror featuring the famous “Bisso Galeto” a legendary monster living in the
                surroundings of Verona, a suitcase full of crocheted newborn clothes and a chest with porn magazines from the
                fifties.
